            stigma: "He committed suicide.",
            options: ["He died by suicide.", "He completed his mission.", "He was a coward."],
            correct: "He died by suicide.",
            why: "The word 'commit' historically associates suicide with crimes or sins. Using 'died by' recognizes it as a tragic health-related outcome."
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            stigma: "She's a suicidal person.",
            options: ["She's mental.", "She's experiencing suicidal thoughts.", "She's a victim."],
            correct: "She's experiencing suicidal thoughts.",
            why: "People-first language ensures we don't define someone solely by their struggles. They are a person first."
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            stigma: "The attempt was successful.",
            options: ["The attempt was fatal.", "The person won.", "The attempt worked."],
            correct: "The attempt was fatal.",
            why: "Terms like 'successful' frame a tragic death as an achievement. Use 'fatal' or 'died by suicide' instead."
        },
        {
            id: 4,
            stigma: "Suicide is for cowards.",
            options: ["Suicide is a sin.", "Suicide is a result of extreme pain.", "Only weak people do it."],
            correct: "Suicide is a result of extreme pain.",
            why: "Judging someone in crisis increases stigma. Most people are simply looking for a way to stop overwhelming pain."
        },
        {
            id: 5,
            stigma: "They're schizophrenic.",
            options: ["They have schizophrenia.", "They're crazy.", "They're hearing things."],
            correct: "They have schizophrenia.",
            why: "Using 'They have' instead of 'They're' emphasizes that the person is separate from their diagnosis."
        },

            id: 6,
            stigma: "It was an unsuccessful attempt.",
            options: ["They failed.", "They survived the attempt.", "It didn't work."],
            correct: "They survived the attempt.",
            why: "Framing survival as 'unsuccessful' is logically and emotionally incorrect. Survival is an opportunity for help."

            id: 7,
            stigma: "He's just an addict.",

            correct: "He's living with substance use disorder.",
            why: "Labels like 'addict' reduce a person to their condition. Focusing on the disorder centers health."
